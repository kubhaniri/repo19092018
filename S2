We provide a customized all-in-one Eclipse based distribution that makes application development easy. The tool suites provide ready-to-use combinations of language support, framework support, and runtime support, and combine them with the existing Java, Web and Java EE tooling from Eclipse. An integrated dashboard in the distribution makes it trivial to install further extensions that add support for technologies such as Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Gradle or Pivotal tcServer.
